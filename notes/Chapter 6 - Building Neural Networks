# Chapter 6: Building Neural Networks

We now have some machinery (the Value class) to build out some pretty complex mathematial expressions. We can therefore start to build Neural Networks.

## Building out a Mutli-Layer Perceptron

Our Neural Network is made of multiple layers. These layers are themselves made of mutliple neurons. The neurons in a layer are not connected to each others but are each fully connected with the input (which can be the input layer or the previous hidden layer).

A layer is therefore simply a set of neurons.

## Creating an MLP in Code

We wrote the Neuron, Layer, and MLP classes that can be used to create a n layers network of y-dimmensional neurons where each layer can itself have a specific number of neurons.

This leads to more complicated graphs!
